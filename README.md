#Random Sentence
This program generates a sentence by randomly picking words from the built-in english language dictionary. This is the second step in the NLP Tweet Generator project I'm working on.

##How It Works
1. The function takes in a number of type Int.
2. The function generates a sentence of length(number).
3. The sentence has random words from the built-in english dictionary.
